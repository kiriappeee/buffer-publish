## What is Buffer Publish?

<img src="https://rawgit.com/bufferapp/buffer-publish/master/screenshot.png">

Buffer Publish is [Buffer](https://buffer.com)'s new dashboard with a focus on one thing; **managing and publishing content on your social accounts.** It's a redesign and refresh of the current Buffer dashboard, both in appearance and front-end architecture.

Buffer Publish is being actively developed right now! This code is open source for any and all to see and learn from ‚Äî see our [copyright](#copyright) below for more details.

If you have any questions feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-publish/issues/new) or Tweet us [@bufferdevs](https://twitter.com/bufferdevs). We'd love to chat!

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Important Note**: While you can pull this code down freely, it won't work correctly without some key components (including our API) which are not open source.

## Quick Start

To get started on local development and testing:

1. **Get your `buffer-dev` environment setup**
  ‚Üí https://github.com/bufferapp/buffer-dev

2. **Install the latest version of `yarn`**
  ‚Üí [Installing Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

3. **Make sure you have node with version <= 9 (Node v10 is not compatible)**
    ```
    $ node -v
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/buffer-dev/buffer-publish  # Or wherever yours is located
    $ yarn
   ```

5. **Start up the publish docker containers**
    ```bash
    $ cd ../buffer-dev
    $ ./dev up session-service core-authentication-service login publish
   ```

   Publish relies on both the **session** and **account** services, so it's important to include them in our _up_ command. The order is important, since this relates to the way docker-compose starts up containers.

6. **Start bundling the frontend with webpack**
    ```bash
    # in buffer-publish/
    $ yarn run watch
   ```
     While you're waiting for the bundle to finish, head on over to https://local.buffer.com to login. (We're not quite ready to view Publish yet.)

7. **Give yourself the correct feature flip**
  In order to view Buffer Publish your user (usually admin@bufferapp.com for local dev)
 must have the _New Buffer Publish_ feature flip. Otherwise you'll just get redirected back to classic Buffer. To add the feature visit https://local.buffer.com/admin and browse to the _My Account_ page.

   If you don't have the feature flip available, then you should probably pull down all the feature flips from production first:
   ```bash
   # in ~/buffer-dev
   $ ./dev sync features
   ```
8. You should now be able to visit https://publish.local.buffer.com ‚Äî party time! üéâ üôå

### Troubleshooting Dev Environment Issues

Coming soon.

## The Publish Server

When you run the `./dev up` command from the [quick start](#quick-start) it spins up a number of containers on which Publish depends. It also spins up the `publish` container itself, which is [an Express server](/packages/server/index.js) with two purposes:

1. **Serve [`index.html`](/packages/server/index.html) for all requests to https://publish.local.buffer.com**
3. **Provide an `/rpc` endpoint/proxy** for making API calls in the front-end

In the past the publish container's Express server also ran webpack and bundled the front-end code, **we decoupled this however when we started seeing instability and broken file watching within the container**. Webpack bundling now happens **on the host system**; which is why you run `yarn run watch` as a final step.

## Yarn Workspaces

Buffer Publish is a _monorepo_. That means it's composed of several separate parts, or _packages._ (You can take a look at these packages in the [`/packages` directory](/packages)) These are essentially the same as packages on npm. We use `yarn workspaces` to make this magic possible. üé©.  (_And if you're confused by this at all, skimming their [README](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) files should help!_)

## ~~Publishing Packages~~

No need to publish local packages anymore for deployments üéâ

## Package Scripts

We have a few helpful commands defined in this project's `package.json`.

| Command | Description |
|--|--|
| `yarn`  | This goes through all packages, installs dependencies and links local packages together! ‚ú® |
| `yarn run clean`  | Deletes all `node_modules` from all packages. Use this first if you see any odd dependency errors and then follow with `yarn`. |
| `yarn run test`  | Runs `yarn test` on all packages. |
| `yarn run test-update`  | Runs `yarn run test-update` on all packages to update all snapshot tests. |
`yarn test:debug <path to test>` | Runs `"node --inspect node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand"` with the test you specify.
| `yarn run start`  | Starts up the Publish Express server, [as explained above](#the-publish-server), and is run automatically when you start Publish with `./dev up`. (So in most cases you won't be running this command.) |

## Adding New Dependencies

Adding packages to a monorepo is slightly different than adding to a standard node package. Common `devDependencies` can be added to the top level `package.json` file.

### Adding A Common Dependencies

This is the most likely scenario you'll face.

in the root directory (`buffer-publish/`) run the follwing commands:

```bash
$ yarn add -DE some-cool-package
$ yarn
```

Now `some-cool-package` is available to all packages.

### Creating A Dependency To Another Local Package

|‚ö†Ô∏è  &nbsp;**Important**|
|--|
|Please use 2.0.0 for local package versions moving forward. Using a different version will not break anything (as long as the versions match), but it will be easier to spot local packages in dependencies.|

To create a dependency to the login package from the example package:

In the `example` package add the following entry in the `packages/example/package.json` file under the dependencies key:

```js
{
  //...other stuff...
  dependencies:{
    //...other dependencies...
    "@bufferapp/login": "2.0.0", // this version must be exact otherwise it fetches from npm!
  }
}
```
|‚ö†Ô∏è  &nbsp;**Important**|
|--|
|The version number must be **exact** to link local packages, otherwise it will (try to) fetch the package from npm.|


### Add A Dependency That Runs A Binary

An example of this would be `eslint` or `jest`. These should be added to the individual package:

```sh
cd packages/example/
yarn add -DE jest
```

## How Packages Communicate

At a high level each package communicates using the [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) through the Redux store. This means that each package receives all events and decides whether to modify their own state or ignore the event. An event (or action) flows from the originator to all other packages (including itself):


```
Package-A ---action--->Redux Store--->Package-B
  ^                             |
  |-----------------------------|---->Package-C
```

If you need to listen to another packages events, import the actionTypes into the package you're building:


```js
// handle app initialized
export default (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'APP_INIT':
      return {
        ...state,
        initialized: true,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```
## Testing

### Debugging

To use the `yarn test:debug` script, follow these instructions:
1. Add a `debugger` statement near the failing line in your test.
2. Type `chrome://inspect` in your chrome browser address bar.
3. Click on "Open dedicated DevTools for Node".
4. In your terminal run `yarn test:debug <path to test>`
5. Visit the inspector you opened up, you should see that the debugger has been triggered and the app has paused near the line that is failing.

## External Packages

These are packages that have been moved outside of the Publish application.
